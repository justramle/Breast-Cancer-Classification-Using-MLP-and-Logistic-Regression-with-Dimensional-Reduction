### MLPs for Breast Cancer Classification

- Implementation of a neural network designed to classify breast cancer samples into malignant or benign categories
- Feedforward Processing: Calculates the linear combination of inputs and weights (weighted sum), adds bias, and applies the sigmoid activation function to estimate the probability of belonging to a particular class.
- Backpropagation: Adjusts weights and biases based on the error between predicted and actual values, using a simple gradient descent approach.
- Prediction: Classifies samples by applying the trained model to new data, returning a binary output based on a threshold.
